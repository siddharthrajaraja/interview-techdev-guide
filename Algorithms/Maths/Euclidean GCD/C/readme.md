GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them. A simple way to find GCD is to factorize both numbers and multiply common factors.

# Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD
The algorithm is based on below facts.



### If we subtract smaller number from larger (we reduce larger number), GCD doesnâ€™t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
### Now instead of subtraction, if we divide smaller number, the algorithm stops when we find remainder 0.
